<p>First of all, as Pythonist, I'm a big <a href='http://getnikola.com/' >Nikola</a> fan, if you don't know Nikola project you should definitely check it out. It's a great Static Site and Blog generator and the codebase is all Python, the project is very mature and includes douzen of plugins and free templates. I used Nikola to create few websites: <a href='http://pybcn.org/' >http://pybcn.org/</a> &amp; <a href='http://emerzia.com/' >http://emerzia.com/</a> <br />
It has all the advances, quick to learn, clear documentation and very easily hackable, in few minutes you can create a site with Nikola: <a href='http://getnikola.com/creating-a-site-not-a-blog-with-nikola.html' >http://getnikola.com/creating-a-site-not-a-blog-with-nikola.html</a></p>

<h3 id="sowhymovingtoghost">So why moving to Ghost?</h3>

<p>There is 2 important quality I like from Nikola: <br />
- Static: Improve security, hosting cost highly reduced (or free) and performance. If you have used Wordpress in the past, at some stage you had security issues, either a plugins that bring some vunerability or the setup of WP wasn't perfect.
- Python: When you need to do some changes into your blog engine, you definitely appreciate if the codebase is the actual language you work with.
Thumbs-ups!</p>

<p>Nikola fitted perfectly for my needs on side creation and still does, but not for blogging, when blogging I wanted a tool on which I feel I was writing, not coding, something like Wordpress but without the issues of WP, slow, own hosting, security problem.</p>

<p>Here comes <a href='https://ghost.org/' >Ghost</a>, simple blogging engine, write your post with 'markdown', kind of WYSIWYG feeling, let's share a screenshot: <br />
<img src='http://local.areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/ghost_screenshot.jpg'  alt="Ghost Screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href='https://ghost.org/' >Ghost</a> provide hosting but all the code is fully Open Source (<a href='https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost' >Github</a>) and so you can host it yourself. Now I'm a big fan of Github Pages : <a href='http://pages.github.com/' >http://pages.github.com/</a> if your site is static, it's a nice way to get free &amp; performan hosting.</p>

<p>Came at the rescue Buster (Yes like in GhostBuster), this python project will allow you to scrape your local Ghost website, save it into a static directory and push it to your Github repo where you host your website : <br />
<a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buster/' >https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buster/</a> <br />
Introduction to buster : <a href='http://blog.axitkhurana.com/introducing-buster/' >http://blog.axitkhurana.com/introducing-buster/</a></p>

<p>This is quite a neat way to get the good of all sides, enjoy the nicest blogging engine, get a great hosting without worry and even be able to blog offline in train, plane, wherever you feel like writing.</p>

<p>So check out Ghost, it might not be the right tool for you but it will certainly inspire you!</p>]]></description><link>http://local.areskibelaid.com/from-nikola-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cc2527a1-1acc-4380-9e98-e73cb963041e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Areski Belaid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 12:57:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telefony Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://local.areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/phone_vintage2.jpg'  alt="main-image" /></p>

<p>Lately I spent most my time working on several Open Sources projects, few of them which I authored and maintained: Newfies-Dialer, CDR-Stats, Python-NVD3, Django-Frontend-notification, and other which I simply find great and useful: Django, Nikola. Maintaining them is a #shit# lot of work, specially if you have to do your job on the side or keep running a company and have a life, usually free time turn out to be rare as water in the desert... and in my case I set a very low priority in keeping a geeky-diary/blog. My previous blog started 9 years ago, I did few posts the first months when the motivation was at his high, then it get lost among pile of work, todolists and projects...</p>

<p>I really wonder how peoples keep themselves motivated in writing and make sure this is not something that turn into the next NewYear resolution. If you have advices please shoot?</p>

<p>This is <em>my</em> new attempt in blogging, a remedy in sharing text rather than code! I hope to get some feedback on posts in order to keep motivation high, certainly this will only happen if write something worth reading (not there yet).</p>

<p>So this blog would be about my experience, some of my knowledges, the things I learnt the hard way or topics that I found a bit lost in the immensity of <strong>the Internet</strong> and which could use a good write-ups.</p>

<p><img src='http://local.areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/the_internet.jpg'  alt="The Internet" /></p>

<p>I guess we will see a lot of Python here, but lately I'm doing some efforts to not be too religeous about it, I'm interested into better programming and fast deployment, Continuous Integration, Testing, but most of all Telefony &amp; VoIP, that give us an idea of some of the topics I would love to share.</p>

<p>Ideas for the upcoming blog posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getstarted with FreeSWITCH</li>
<li>MongoDB, aggregation</li>
<li>Django and Travis-CI</li>
<li>DevOps with SaltStack</li>
<li>Deploy your Django site on Docker</li>
<li>Realtime with Django</li>
</ul>

<p>I love recipes and tutorials, so I hope plenty of them will be coming and that will help and give some guidance to other developers. I will sure be learning a lot along the way too :)</p>

<p>/Enjoy your visit!</p>]]></description><link>http://local.areskibelaid.com/that-s-the-spirit-of-blogging/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">694fb9f3-ee64-4b6d-85a1-c964af6a260d</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Areski Belaid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2014 09:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
