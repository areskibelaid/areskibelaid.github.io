<p>Why share new pictures when there are good old ones ?</p>

<p>I dug in my archive folder and found a few good picks that had never had the chance to hit the Web. They are a year old and were taken during a trip to Costa Rica &amp; Nicaragua. I hope you enjoy them, they are full of good memories!</p>

<p>There have been huge amounts of exciting <a href='http://golang.org/' >Go</a> projects emerging in the last year, just to give a brief list of the ones I found very interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Docker: <a href='http://www.docker.io/' >http://www.docker.io/</a> which has just announced their new release 0.8 (<a href='http://blog.docker.io/2014/02/docker-0-8-quality-new-builder-features-btrfs-storage-osx-support/' >http://blog.docker.io/2014/02/docker-0-8-quality-new-builder-features-btrfs-storage-osx-support/</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Viewdocs: <a href='https://github.com/progrium/viewdocs' >https://github.com/progrium/viewdocs</a> when <a href='https://readthedocs.org/' >Read the Docs</a> meets <a href='http://gist.io/' >Gist.io</a>, a pretty small codebase but shows the huge potential of Go</p></li>
<li><p>Etcd: A highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service discovery <a href='https://github.com/coreos/etcd' >https://github.com/coreos/etcd</a></p></li>
<li><p>CGrates: Rating system for telecom operators 
<a href='http://cgrates.org/' >http://cgrates.org</a></p></li>
<li><p>Vitess: it's a library that provides tools that facilitate the scaling of MySQL databases to large scale web services, built by Youtube <a href='https://github.com/youtube/vitess' >https://github.com/youtube/vitess</a></p></li>
<li><p>Tiedot: It's a low-resource NoSQL database implemented in Go. It's designed to be easily embeddable in Go programs, but also runs as a standalone HTTP service. <a href='https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/tiedot' >https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/tiedot</a></p></li>
<li><p>Boom: HTTP(S) load generator <a href='https://github.com/rakyll/boom' >https://github.com/rakyll/boom</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="advantagesofgo">Advantages of Go</h3>

<p>Go has very interesting properties compared to other languages: </p>

<ul>
<li>Provides Light Syntax</li>
<li>Supports concurrency at the language level, thanks to the <a href='https://gobyexample.com/goroutines' >Go routines</a></li>
<li>Compiles very quickly</li>
<li>Includes garbage collection</li>
<li>Scales Go Routines extremely well</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems to be a perfect fit for scientific computing, high concurrency, server applications, and talking with little experience of Go, it also seems to be a good fit for web: <br />

<h3 id="isgolangthenewlanguagetolearn">Is Golang the new language to learn?</h3>

<p>If you fancy learning something new today, why not? Go is a great language, growing a lot in popularity and adoption in companies. As a Programming Language, Go is a pragmatic evolution of C and  includes countless benefits of other languages like Python &amp; Ruby.</p>

<p>A good place to get started could be <a href='https://gobyexample.com/' >Go by Example</a>. </p>

<p>Are you learning Go, if so what is your opinion on the language? Would Go take a huge part of our IT ecosystem in the following years?</p>]]></description><link>http://areskibelaid.com/learn-some-go/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">661aacb0-0d99-48b3-95ff-e0512c3a6094</guid><category><![CDATA[docker]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Areski Belaid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2014 12:51:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Nikola to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png'  alt="main-image" /></p>

<p><a href='http://getnikola.com/' >Nikola</a>  a great Static Site and Blog generator and the codebase is all Python which is a great plus for Pythonist, the project is very mature and includes douzen of plugins and free templates. So quite a good choice if you look at a solution for your next website!</p>

<p>If you don't know Nikola project you should definitely check it out. I used Nikola to create few websites: <a href='http://pybcn.org/' >http://pybcn.org/</a> &amp; <a href='http://emerzia.com/' >http://emerzia.com/</a> and it has been just pure pleasure! <br />
It comes with a bunch of great plus compare to others, it's very fast to learn, the documentation is clear as the codebase which is very easily hackable. Take few minutes and go ahead to create a simple site: <a href='http://getnikola.com/creating-a-site-not-a-blog-with-nikola.html' >http://getnikola.com/creating-a-site-not-a-blog-with-nikola.html</a></p>

<h3 id="sowhymovingtoghost">So why moving to Ghost?</h3>

<p>There is 2 important quality I appreciate from Nikola: <br />
- Static: Improve security, hosting cost highly reduced (or free) and performance. If you have used Wordpress in the past, at some stage you had security issues, either a plugins that bring some vunerability or the setup of WP wasn't perfect.
- Python: When you need to do some changes into your blog engine, you definitely appreciate if the codebase is the actual language you work with.
Thumbs-ups!</p>

<p>Nikola fitted perfectly for my needs on side creation and still does, but not for blogging, when blogging I wanted a tool on which I feel I was writing, not coding, something like Wordpress but without the issues of WP, slow, own hosting, security problem.</p>

<p>Here comes <a href='https://ghost.org/' >Ghost</a>, simple blogging engine, write your post with 'markdown', kind of WYSIWYG feeling, let's share a screenshot: <br />
<img src='http://areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/ghost_screenshot-1.jpg'  alt="Ghost Screenshot" /></p>

<p><a href='https://ghost.org/' >Ghost</a> provide hosting but all the code is fully Open Source (<a href='https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost' >Github</a>) and so you can host it yourself. Now I'm a big fan of Github Pages : <a href='http://pages.github.com/' >http://pages.github.com/</a> if your site is static, it's a nice way to get free &amp; performan hosting.</p>

<p>Came at the rescue Buster (Yes like in GhostBuster), this python project will allow you to scrape your local Ghost website, save it into a static directory and push it to your Github repo where you host your website : <br />
<a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buster/' >https://pypi.python.org/pypi/buster/</a> <br />
Introduction to buster : <a href='http://blog.axitkhurana.com/introducing-buster/' >http://blog.axitkhurana.com/introducing-buster/</a></p>

<p>This is quite a neat way to get the good of all sides, enjoy the nicest blogging engine, get a great hosting without worry and even be able to blog offline in train, plane, wherever you feel like writing.</p>

<p><img src='https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png'  alt="main-image" /></p>

<p>So check out Ghost, it might not be the right tool for you but it will certainly inspire you!</p>]]></description><link>http://areskibelaid.com/from-nikola-to-ghost/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cc2527a1-1acc-4380-9e98-e73cb963041e</guid><category><![CDATA[ghost]]></category><category><![CDATA[nikola]]></category><category><![CDATA[blog]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Areski Belaid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 12:57:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telefony Open Source Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/phone_vintage.jpg'  alt="main-image" /></p>

<p>Getting started with Docker is very simple, I'm going to give you a very simple recipe to get started quickly, I would first recommend to use <a href='https://www.digitalocean.com/' >DigitalOcean</a>, they provide box with Ubuntu 13.10 and Docker ready for you, so at a very low cost you can start playing with Docker and not have to worry to install anything locally.</p>

<p>If you wish to install Docker locally you can follow this guide : <a href='https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/' #h_installation'>https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation</a></p>

<p>Ready!? So let's play with Docker then, you can now type <code>docker</code> and you will get list of all available commands.</p>

<h3 id="letsrunechohelloworldonanewubuntucontainer">Let's run echo 'hello world' on a new Ubuntu container</h3>

<p>Type the following: <br />
<code>docker run ubuntu /bin/echo hello world</code></p>

<p>This should output 'hello world'. Just one line?</p>

<p>Docker did all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>It downloaded the base image from the docker index</li>
<li>it created a new LXC container</li>
<li>It allocated a filesystem for it</li>
<li>Mounted a read-write layer</li>
<li>Allocated a network interface</li>
<li>Setup an IP for it, with network address translation</li>
<li>And then executed a process in there</li>
<li>Captured its output and printed it to you</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also run an interactive shell session inside the container</p>

<p><code>docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash</code></p>

<p>To detach from the container crtl-p + crtl-q</p>

<p>Searching for a docker image: <code>docker search [image name]</code></p>

<p>Try: <code>docker search ubuntu</code></p>

<h3 id="letsdosomethingmoreexcitingnow">Let's do something more exciting now</h3>

<p>Run a container and stay attached to the shell session: <br />
<code>docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash</code></p>

<p>You should see your shell changing to something like:   <code>root@b99484200e8t:/#</code> </p>

<p>Type <code>apt-get update</code> <br />
and now install Apache2 : <code>apt-get install -y apache2</code></p>

<p>Now you can detach (crtl-p + crtl-q)</p>

<p>By default Docker will expose the port 80 of the container to a random port of the host.</p>

<p>So let's list the current containers : <code>docker ps</code> <br />
You should be able to see the port number that is mapped (ie '49158->80'), in your web browser open the IP of your Droplet follow by the mapped port. You should see the Apache running from your docker.</p>

<p>To finish for today, let's now see what happen on our container, let's type <code>docker diff ID_Container</code> (ID_Container you can find it by typing docker ps), with docker diff are able to inspect all the changes made on the container's filesystem.</p>

<p>That's all for this short post, now you can explore the documentation and docker tutorials out there: <a href='http://www.docker.io/' >http://www.docker.io/</a></p>]]></description><link>http://areskibelaid.com/get-started-docker/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">734fb463-1013-420c-a42e-aa7f60934613</guid><category><![CDATA[docker]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Areski Belaid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2014 12:56:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ideas for blogging]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/idea_bulb.jpg'  alt="main-image" /></p>

<p>Lately I spent most my time working on several Open Sources projects, few of them which I authored and maintained: Newfies-Dialer, CDR-Stats, Python-NVD3, Django-Frontend-notification, and other which I simply find great and useful: Django, Nikola. Maintaining them is a #shit# lot of work, specially if you have to do your job on the side or keep running a company and have a life, usually free time turn out to be rare as water in the desert... and in my case I set a very low priority in keeping a geeky-diary/blog. My previous blog started 9 years ago, I did few posts the first months when the motivation was at his high, then it get lost among pile of work, todolists and projects...</p>

<p>I really wonder how peoples keep themselves motivated in writing and make sure this is not something that turn into the next NewYear resolution. If you have advices please shoot?</p>

<p>This is <em>my</em> new attempt in blogging, a remedy in sharing text rather than code! I hope to get some feedback on posts in order to keep motivation high, certainly this will only happen if write something worth reading (not there yet).</p>

<p>So this blog would be about my experience, some of my knowledges, the things I learnt the hard way or topics that I found a bit lost in the immensity of <strong>the Internet</strong> and which could use a good write-ups.</p>

<p><img src='http://areskibelaid.com/content/images/2014/Feb/the_internet.jpg'  alt="The Internet" /></p>

<p>I guess we will see a lot of Python here, but lately I'm doing some efforts to not be too religeous about it, I'm interested into better programming and fast deployment, Continuous Integration, Testing, but most of all Telefony &amp; VoIP, that give us an idea of some of the topics I would love to share.</p>

<p>Ideas for the upcoming blog posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getstarted with FreeSWITCH</li>
<li>MongoDB, aggregation</li>
<li>Django and Travis-CI</li>
<li>DevOps with SaltStack</li>
<li>Deploy your Django site on Docker</li>
<li>Realtime with Django</li>
</ul>

<p>I love recipes and tutorials, so I hope plenty of them will be coming and that will help and give some guidance to other developers. I will sure be learning a lot along the way too :)</p>

<p>/Enjoy your visit!</p>]]></description><link>http://areskibelaid.com/ideas-for-blogging/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">694fb9f3-ee64-4b6d-85a1-c964af6a260d</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Areski Belaid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2014 09:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
